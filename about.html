            <p>Radiohead are an English rock band formed in Abingdon-on-Thames in
                 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, 
                 keyboards), brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, 
                 other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass), Ed O'Brien (gui-
                 tar, backing vocals) and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They
                 have worked with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley 
                 Donwood since 1994.</p>

            <p>After signing to EMI in 1991, Radiohead released their debut single 
            "Creep" in 1992. It became a worldwide hit after the release of their 
            debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Their popularity and critical standing 
            rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The 
            Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them 
            international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern 
            alienation, it is often acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s[1] and 
            one of the best albums in popular music.[2][3] The group's next albums Kid 
            A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), recorded simultaneously, marked a dramatic 
            change in style, incorporating influences from experimental electronic music,
            20th-century classical music, krautrock, and jazz. Kid A divided listeners 
            but was named the best album of the decade by Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and 
            The Times.</p>

            
            <p>Radiohead's sixth album, Hail to the Thief (2003), mixed rock and 
            electronic music with lyrics inspired by the War on Terror, and was the
            band's final album for EMI. Their subsequent releases have pioneered 
            alternative release platforms such as pay-what-you-want and BitTorrent; 
            Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a 
            download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and 
            chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration
            of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped 
            Pool (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements.</p>
